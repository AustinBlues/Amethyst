If the RSS feeds you subscribe too are fine, you can ignore this file.  If
there are certain topics, people, countries you wish to ignore, read on.
These topics are considered sludge and filtered out using the Maria/MySQL
database's full text search extension using its boolean mode.  This tutorial
assumes you are using the bash command line shell.  Other shells and GUI start
up is left as an exercise for the reader.

Examples:
To stay viewpoint neutral, these examples use the Red Queen, Alice, Tweedledum,
and Tweedledee from "Alice in Wonderland".  Define the SLUDGE environment
variable before starting the background task with:
  padrino rake -e production resque:work QUEUE=*  

1) Hide every post that mentions Tweedledum ('+' indicate the following word
is required).  Remember SLUDGE is negative:
  export SLUDGE="+Tweedledum"
  
2) Hide every post that mentions Tweedledum AND Tweedledee:
  export SLUDGE="+Tweedledum +Tweedledee"

3) Hide every post that mentions Tweedledum OR Tweedledee ('<' indicates words
with a lesser match):
  export SLUDGE="<Tweedledum <Tweedledee"

4) Hide every post that mentions the Red Queen (single quotes enclose multiple
words to match):
  export SLUDGE="+'Red Queen'"

5) Show every post that mentions Alice (to pull Alice up out of the sludge):
  export SLUDGE="-Alice"

6) To hide all posts mentioning the Red Queen and to lesser extent,
Tweedledum, and Tweedledee, but show all post mentioning Alice anyway:
  export SLUDGE"+'Red Queen' <Tweedledum <Tweedledee -Alice"

7) Like the previous one, but Alice does not entirely override Tweedledum and
Tweedledee's presence:
  export SLUDGE"+'Red Queen' <Tweedledum <Tweedledee ~Alice"
