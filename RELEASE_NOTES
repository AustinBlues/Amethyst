Amethyst2Beta2 is bug fix and improved navigation minor or patch release.
Bugs: Hiding the last post on a page corrupted the back (left) arrow link.  It
  would return to the same page in an endless loop.  Note: the Amethyst logo
  in the upper left corner will always return to the home page, "/post".
Navigation improvement: Deleting a feed will now return to the same page as
  the feed was on instead of the first page.
