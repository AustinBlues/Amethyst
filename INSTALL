Note: Little effort has been made to harden Amethyst against malicious users.
It is strongly suggested that you do not expose it to the Internet or hostile
users.  These directions are for running Amethyst on the loopback port (no
access from other computers) as an ordinary user, not root.

Download the code:
  git clone https://github.com/AustinBlues/Amethyst.git
  git checkout tags/Amethyst2Beta2

  Note: the directory name is used to namespace the database and the Redis
  data.  You may wish to change the directory name to avoid clashes with other
  applications using the database server and the Redis in-memory keyâ€“value
  database.  You will need to adjust the direction below if you use a
  different directory name.

Change to the Amethyst directory:
  cd Amethyst

Create the database(s) and and give user necessary privilege as MariaDB or MySQL root:
  mysql -u root -p
  create database Amethyst_test;
  create database Amethyst_production;
  create database Amethyst_development;
  grant all privileges on Amethyst_test.* TO 'amethyst'@'localhost' identified by 'mypwd';
  grant all privileges on Amethyst_development.* TO 'amethyst'@'localhost' identified by 'mypwd';
  grant all privileges on Amethyst_production.* TO 'amethyst'@'localhost' identified by 'mypwd';
  quit;

Install Ruby (2.4.0 preferred) and Redis.  They are included in most Linux
distributions.

Install the gems:
  bundle install
  gem install redis-namespace
  
Initialize the database(s):
  bundle exec padrino rake -e test sq:migrate:up
  bundle exec padrino rake -e production sq:migrate:up
  bundle exec padrino rake -e development sq:migrate:up

Create the necessary cron jobs (see REFRESH below for explanation):
  crontab -e

  Add the following lines if using installed Ruby (use output of "which ruby")
    */5 * * * * cd /home/user/Amethyst;  ruby enqueue_refresh.rb
    4 * * * * /home/user/Amethyst/cron-daily
    
  Add the following lines if using RVM Ruby 2.4.0 for user 'user' and directory "Amethyst":
    */5 * * * * cd /home/user/Amethyst;  /home/user/.rvm/wrappers/ruby-2.4.0/ruby enqueue_refresh.rb
    4 * * * * /home/user/Amethyst/cron-daily

Start the RSS feed fetch process (see REFRESH below for explanation):
  cd Amethyst
  bundle exec padrino rake -e production resque:work QUEUE=*

In another window start the server process (any port above 1024 will do):
  cd Amethyst
  bundle exec padrino start -e production --port=3002
