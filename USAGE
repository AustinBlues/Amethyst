The initial screen is the Post index.  It will be empty until you add a Feed.
Click the left arrow of the left side of the banner of the Feed and Post
indexes to cycle between them.

In the Feed screen, click the plus sign in the upper right to add RSS URLs.  The
feed will be added, initially with the URL as the title.  Wait a several seconds
for the feed to download and then click on it.  The Post titles will be listed.
Click on a title to open it.  You will see the title in the blue box and the
description below it.  The post is now considered read and will not show
again. Clicking on the title will open the original post in a new window/tab.
Clicking on the left hooking arrow will mark it as unread and return to the
original listing of posts.  Clicking on the 'x' to the right of that will hide
the post, i.e the post is not unread and its feed will not increase its score
(see SCORING below).  Clicking on the down arrow will decrease the post's
feed's score.  Use the left arrow to return to the Feed (or Post screen).

You can return to the Feed screen, then click the left arrow to go to the Post
screen.  The posts will be listed newest at the top.

It generally best to not use the browser's back and forward arrows to get the
most out of Amethyst.

SCORING
  Feeds are listed in order of decreasing score, i.e., highest first.
The more posts in a Feed you read, the higher the score.

REFRESH
  Feeds are refreshed every hour.  How often an RSS feed is updated can be
specified in it.  Every feed I've seen with it, has been one hour.
Accomodating anything different would be a complexity that, IMHO, is
unnecessary.  Refreshing is spread as evenly as possible across the hour,
e.g. with two feeds, they will be refreshed a half hour apart.  Five minutes
has been picked as a convenient interval to run the refresh (the first of the
two cron jobs above).  Changing is is left as an exercise for the user.

Once a day, old posts are deleted and other daily cleanup and backup is done
by the second cron of the cron jobs listed in INSTALL.  cron_daily is a script
to do this.  It accommodates computers that may not always be on.  The cron
job assumes the computer is on at least an hour a day.  Run it more frequently
if needed.  Or once a day for a computer that is always on.
