# Amethyst2
Amethyst2 is an RSS/ATOM feed reader Web server inspired by Amphetadisk
(https://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/).

# Preface
This is the production release of Amethyst 2.0.  Amethyst 1.0 was written for
Ruby on Rails, but keeping up with the Rails releases and adding new features
was too much for one developer.  It was also written for multiple users, a
market that I never found enough users for.  Eventually, sticking with the
last release of Rails 2 broke and I started over.

Amethyst 2 is written in Ruby for the Padrino Web framework
(https://padrinorb.com), think Ruby on Rails 1 or Sinatra on steroids.  All
development and testing has been done on Ruby 2.4.0.  See Gemfile for other
dependencies.
