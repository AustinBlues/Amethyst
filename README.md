Note: If you want to play with Amethyst, be sure and use the main branch.  The
master branch was unintentionally pushed to Github.  When I figure out how, I
will delete the master branc.

Amethyst is an RSS/ATOM feed reader Web server inspired by Amphetadisk
(https://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/).  It is in the process of a public
release, but not yet ready.  This file needs to be fleshed out.  The INSTALL
file needs to be written and checked against reality.  Editing the title and
RSS URL of a feed needs to be coded.  It is quite usable if you can work
around the missing bits.

Amethyst is written in Ruby for the Padrino Web framework (think Ruby on Rails
1 or Sinatra on steroids).

This will be a beta release of Amethyst 2.0.  Amethyst 1.0 was written with
Ruby on Rails, but keeping up with the Rails releases and adding new features
was too much for one developer.  It was also written for multiple users for a
market that I never found enough users for.  Eventually, sticking with the
last release of Rails 2 broke and I started over.
