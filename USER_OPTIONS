Amethyst can be customized at run time by setting environment variables.  It
is also possible to change them by altering them in
config/initializers/user_options.rb though this will cause conflicts that have
to be resolved by hand when pulling new verions from Github.

Items per page (PAGE_SIZE)
  The default is 10.  For unusually large or small screens you may wish to
change it

Pagination (AMETHYST_PAGINATION)
  Usual practice has been to put the pagination links below the list.  Because
RSS item title can be more than one line, this causes the absolute location of
the links to shift up and down.  The default in Amethyst is to put them above
the list.  The default can be overridden at run time with the
AMETHYST_PAGINATION shell environment variable.  Its value is interpreted as a
binary number.  Set it to OR of the values you want:
  FEED_TOP = 0b1000
  FEED_BOTTOM = 0b0100
  POST_TOP = 0b0010
  POST_BOTTOM = 0b0001
For example: "export AMETHYST_PAGINATION=0101" enables bottom pagination.  It
is possible to top paginate Feeds and bottom paginate Posts (1001).
